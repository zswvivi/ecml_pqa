B003VX3S3Y	  Does anyone have a link to the toshiba stacker program? 	  Here is a review that I only copied. READ THIS if you want to use these on Windows 7 Ult 64bit, January 26, 2013 By roscolo This review is from: 2 X Mini Usb Bluetooth V2.0 Edr Dongle Wireless Adapter (Electronics) OK. First the bad news, then read on for the good news: First, this absolutely will not work with Windows 7 Ultimate 64bit with the generic plug-n-play Windows Driver that automatically installs. Anyone who has it working, it is because your computer manufacturer or motherboard manufacturer has different drivers. OK. That's the bad news. Now the good news. You can make these work easily with a utility that is FAR, FAR BETTER than any built in Windows junk. What you NEED for this to work exceptionally well on Windows 7 Ultimate 64bit is to do a Google search for: [ &quot;toshiba bluetooth stack&quot; premium edition ] Before you ask, NO, this does not mean your computer has to be made by Toshiba or have anything to do with Toshiba for this to work on your system. If you type in the search terms exactly as I just showed you, with the quotes, what you need will be one of the top results. If you have 64bit system, make sure you unzip and install 64bit. If you have 32bit system (x86) make sure you unzip and install 32bit version. Follow instructions, and these el cheapo bluetooth dongles will now work very well on Windows 7 Ultimate 64bit. Will they last? Remains to be seen. Enjoy.

The suction cup unit will as they all will, eventually fall off when directly applied to the windshield. Why, I don't know, but it will not come off the disc, and the disc will not come off the windshield or dashboard. Clean all surfaces with alcohol. Position the disc carefully because once set on the windshield you won't be able to remove it and reuse it.....Hint, put the suction cup on the disc, then &quot;shop it around&quot; for best location...then mark the window with a marker, then remove suction unit from disc, then remove covering from adhesive side of disc, and press the disc onto the windshield or dash location you marked.

B00064NGRO	  The best lathe: What is the best woodworking lathe out there? 	  Like with many tools, it depends on what you want to do. I started with a used Atlas lathe that didn't have variable speed but step pulleys and learned that it didn't go slow enough for an out of balance bowl blank. It was fine for spindle turning just not safe for faceplate. If you're just playing with the idea of turning find a used one on Craigslist with variable speed and a 10/12&quot; swing. Jet mini lathes are quite popular with new trurners. The best lathe is a matter of opinion-I'm partial to a Oneway 1640 but unless I could justify it with making money off of it I would go for the Jet 1642, 2 hp. I also have Delta 460 midi.

B003DIMKRM	  Does this fit 8 oz Medela bottles and the Medela ice pack? 	  I think it will, worst case scenario would be that you might only be able to put bottles on one side. I use a similar icepack that is made to put cans on each side but I have fat 10 oz bottles so I put 3 on one side and I lay a spring water bottle one across the top of everything for me before I close it. Lets face it though, you aren't gonna pack more than three bottles in this as the ice pack itself will only last so long. So if you had 6 in there, by the time you got to number 4, they won't be kept cold enough. Nice pack though. I have abused mine terribly and it saved me many times. I put 3 diapers (my baby is size 6) and a small personal size wipes in the top. Bah bahs in the bottom and its a lot easier to carry this than a cooler for sure. You can just sling it over the back of baby carriage where you push.
